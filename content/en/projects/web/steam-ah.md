The new Steam library interface allows you to sort games by percentage of unlocked achievements, ideal for completing the games with the least achievements first.
{{< /notice >}}

Steam is the online video game platform par excellence. Many of its users are game collectors and others try to achieve as much as possible.

To keep track of the missing achievements in a game can be a very tedious task, especially if you have a large collection.

The solution would be a list with the name of the game and the achievements blocked and unblocked and for that I have created a tool that simplifies the work.

Just enter your SteamID, either the **Steam 64 ID** like [*76561198004956893*](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004956893) or the **URL from the profile** like [Alvaro_SG](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alvaro_SG) and an [API key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).

The project is hosted by OpenShift, so it has limited resources.
