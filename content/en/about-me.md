Hello, my name is **Álvaro Salcedo García**, a software engineer who has been programming since I was 16 years old in my spare time and now is dedicated to it professionally. Specialized in Android and Kotlin, although I also like Go and in general strong and static typed languages.

In my [CV](/docs/cv.en.pdf) I have listed my professional experience as well as my studies and the most interesting projects I have done.

A more detailed list of projects is available [here](../projects/).
